Hello, and welcome to my first blog post! Getting this website online has been a “fun” adventure, but I’m excited to finally share my projects and ideas with you. I haven’t set a regular posting schedule yet, but I’ll update this page as I figure one out!

PROJECT NEWS

Currently, I’m planning out the 7DOF Arm project. Electronics have been taking up most of my time as I want to ensure an affordable prototype for students and hobbyists. I can’t wait to share updates and see people follow along on this journey!

OTHER NEWS

Lately, I’ve also been busy with my NCSSM application. Now that most of that’s wrapped up, I’ll finally have more time to focus on my various projects.
